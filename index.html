<p>MOORE’S LOUNGE aka BILL & RUTH’S

"Moore’s Lounge in Jersey City has bee an institution for the last 40 years and has become a place where the most diverse individuals come together, to experience how things could be and should be in these times in which we live. Jazz exemplifies love, peace and harmony and so with this in mind I invite you to come and partake in my events at Moore’s Lounge, on Friday’s and Sunday’s.

WEEKLY SUNDAYS
“MEET THE ARTIST” SERIES

Every Sunday I be bringing together established, world renowned and extraordinary artists with young, emerging talents, in a “Jazz Clinic” type of setting, performing for a local audience wishful to learn and exchange knowledge about the context in which Jazz music has emerged and is played today. Artists not only perform, but recount highlights of their career and their own story. I then open the Q&A for questions from the audience and to round up the evening, we invite to the stage for a jam session.

FRIDAY FISH FRY JAM

Every Friday aspiring future jazz professionals join our jam session and all enjoy the delicious fish fry made after Ms. Ruth’s legendary recipe.
